# Week 10.2: Understanding Prisma

In this week's lecture, we explored Prisma, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that simplifies database operations for modern application development.

## Overview
- **What is Prisma?**: Prisma serves as a powerful ORM, offering schema definition, query building, and migrations.
- **Key Features**: Prisma provides type safety, auto-completion, and performance optimizations.

## ORMs Explained
- **Object-Relational Mapping**: ORMs abstract database interactions, simplifying CRUD operations.
- **Prisma as an ORM**: Prisma enhances ORM concepts with schema definition, migrations, and type safety.

## Why ORMs?
- **Simplified Syntax**: ORMs replace SQL queries with programming language constructs.
- **Database Abstraction**: ORMs offer a unified API across different databases.
- **Type Safety and Auto-completion**: ORMs like Prisma provide type safety and auto-completion, reducing errors.

## Prisma: Core Components
- **Data Model**: Prisma Schema defines the application's data model.
- **Automated Migrations**: Prisma Migrate generates and applies schema changes.
- **Type Safety with Prisma Client**: Prisma Client provides type-safe database access.
- **Auto-Completion**: Prisma integrates with code editors for auto-completion.

## Installing Prisma
- **Initialize a Project**: Set up a new Node.js project and install Prisma.
- **Configure TypeScript**: Initialize TypeScript and configure the `tsconfig.json` file.
- **Initialize Prisma**: Use `npx prisma init` to initialize Prisma in your project.

## Selecting Your Database
- **Database Options**: Prisma supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB (Preview).
- **Setting Database Connection**: Update the `schema.prisma` file and set the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.

## Defining Models
- **Schema Definition**: Define data models in the `schema.prisma` file.
- **Generate Migrations**: Use Prisma Migrate to generate SQL migrations based on schema changes.

## Exploring Your Databases
- **Using psql**: Connect to your PostgreSQL database and explore tables and data.

## Prisma Client
- **What is Prisma Client?**: Prisma Client is a type-safe query builder tailored to your data model.
- **Generating Prisma Client**: Run `npx prisma generate` to generate the client code.
- **Using Prisma Client**: Use Prisma Client to perform database operations in your application.

## Creating Your First Application
- **Insert**: Use Prisma Client to insert data into the database.
- **Update**: Update existing data in the database using Prisma Client.
- **Get a Userâ€™s Detail**: Fetch user details from the database using Prisma Client.
